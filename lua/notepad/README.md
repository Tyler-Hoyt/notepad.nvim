# Notepad
This is a plugin that is made for project based notes. I thought it would
be a fun little challenge to learn lua and to experiment with some vim api
stuff.

## How To Use
Install with lazy or another package manager that you want. Make sure to run
the setup function as notepad.nvim needs it to create the proper directory. The
default keymap keymap is \<leader\>nn

## TO-DO
- [ ] Add config for file types 
- [ ] Add config for plenary popup configuration
- [ ] Create a popup that is a menu to make notes for a project (this will be
harder)
- [ ] Clean up code and make it more centered around modules
